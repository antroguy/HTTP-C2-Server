### Summary
The HTTPS C2 Server is a C2 framework that utilizes PNG images to establish command and control to deployed clients. I did this strictly for educational purposes in order to gain an understanding of how to develop C2 servers/clients at the system API level, as well as better prepare myself to defend agaisnt malicious threat actors. The C2 server was developed on Ubuntu and the C2 client was developed for Windows 10 OS. Both the C2 server and client were deveveloped in C++. Be aware that this is my first attempt at developing a project in C++, don't expect expert level code! XD
